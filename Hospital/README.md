The key ideas that were  referred are  the pillars of OOPs. The foundation of OOP consists of four pillars.


<h3>Abstraction</h3>
The idea enables us to present the user only the most important information while hiding the implementation from them. Using the concept ,developer updates  quickly over time.

Encapsulation- We may tie the data and functions of a class into an object via encapsulation. It shields information and operations against tampering and manipulation from outside entities. As a result, it also offers security. The finest illustration of encapsulation is a class.


Inheritance- The concept allows us to inherit or acquire the properties of an existing class (parent class) into a newly created class (child class). It is known as inheritance. It provides code reusability.


Polymorphism-Poly and morphs are the two terms from which the word polymorphism is formed. Both poly and morphs refer to forms. It enables us to design methods that share a name but have various method signatures. It enables the developer to produce code that is clear, logical, legible, and robust.
