Object-oriented programming is essentially a concept or technique for computer programming that models software architecture around data or objects rather than functions and logic.A data field is referred to as an object if it has distinct characteristics and behaviour. In OOP, everything is categorised as objects.


Among developers, it is the most often used programming paradigm. Large, complicated, and actively updated or maintained programmes work well with it. It provides fundamental ideas like abstraction, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation, which make programme creation and maintenance easier. These fundamental ideas define OOP.

# User-defined data types called classes serve as the building blocks for specific objects, properties, and methods.
# Objects are instances of a class that were generated using data that was defined. Objects can be an abstract concept or a real-world thing. 

The key ideas that were  referred are  the pillars of OOPs. The foundation of OOP consists of four pillars.

Abstraction-
The idea enables us to present the user only the most important information while hiding the implementation from them. Using the concept ,developer updates  quickly over time.

Encapsulation- We may tie the data and functions of a class into an object via encapsulation. It shields information and operations against tampering and manipulation from outside entities. As a result, it also offers security. The finest illustration of encapsulation is a class.


Inheritance- The concept allows us to inherit or acquire the properties of an existing class (parent class) into a newly created class (child class). It is known as inheritance. It provides code reusability.


Polymorphism-Poly and morphs are the two terms from which the word polymorphism is formed. Both poly and morphs refer to forms. It enables us to design methods that share a name but have various method signatures. It enables the developer to produce code that is clear, logical, legible, and robust.


Exception handling in C++ consist of three keywords: try, throw and catch:
The try statement allows you to define a block of code to be tested for errors while it is being executed.
The throw keyword throws an exception when a problem is detected, which lets us create a custom error.
The catch statement allows you to define a block of code to be executed, if an error occurs in the try block.



The code begins with a Welcome message for the user.

Some inline functions are written.



An inline function is one for which the compiler copies the code from the function definition directly into the code of the calling function rather than creating a separate set of instructions in memory. This eliminates call-linkage overhead and can expose significant optimization opportunities.


Constructor in C++ is a special method that is invoked automatically at the time of object creation. It is used to initialize the data members of new objects generally.
The constructor in C++ has the same name as the class or structure.It is invoked at the time of object creation. It constructs the values i.e. provides data for the 
object which is why it is known as constructors.


Some characteristics of constructors-

Constructor has the same name as the class it belongs to.


Although it is possible, constructors are often declared in the class's public section. However, this isn't a must.

Because constructors don't return values, they lack a return type.

When we create a class object, the function Object() is immediately invoked.
Over
Declaring a function Object() { [native code] } virtual is not permitted.


One cannot inherit a function Object()

Constructor addresses cannot be referenced to.

When allocating memory, the function Object() makes implicit calls to the new and delete operators.
