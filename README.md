Object-oriented programming is essentially a concept or technique for computer programming that models software architecture around data or objects rather than functions and logic.A data field is referred to as an object if it has distinct characteristics and behaviour. In OOP, everything is categorised as objects.



Among developers, it is the most often used programming paradigm. Large, complicated, and actively updated or maintained programmes work well with it. It provides fundamental ideas like abstraction, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation, which make programme creation and maintenance easier. These fundamental ideas define OOP.

# User-defined data types called classes serve as the building blocks for specific objects, properties, and methods.
# Objects are instances of a class that were generated using data that was defined. Objects can be an abstract concept or a real-world thing. 

The key ideas that were  referred are  the pillars of OOPs. The foundation of OOP consists of four pillars.

Abstraction-
The idea enables us to present the user only the most important information while hiding the implementation from them. Using the concept ,developer updates  quickly over time.
Encapsulation- We may tie the data and functions of a class into an object via encapsulation. It shields information and operations against tampering and manipulation from outside entities. As a result, it also offers security. The finest illustration of encapsulation is a class.
Inheritance- 
polymorphism
