Object-oriented programming is essentially a concept or technique for computer programming that models software architecture around data or objects rather than functions and logic.A data field is referred to as an object if it has distinct characteristics and behaviour. In OOP, everything is categorised as objects.





Among developers, it is the most often used programming paradigm. Large, complicated, and actively updated or maintained programmes work well with it. It provides fundamental ideas like abstraction, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation, which make programme creation and maintenance easier. These fundamental ideas define OOP.

 User-defined data types called classes serve as the building blocks for specific objects, properties, and methods.
 Objects are instances of a class that were generated using data that was defined. Objects can be an abstract concept or a real-world thing.Â 




Exception handling in C++ consist of three keywords: try, throw and catch:
The try statement allows you to define a block of code to be tested for errors while it is being executed.
The throw keyword throws an exception when a problem is detected, which lets us create a custom error.
The catch statement allows you to define a block of code to be executed, if an error occurs in the try block.
