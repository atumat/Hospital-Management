Created Hospital Management System using Object Oriented Programming  in C++
Object-oriented programming is essentially a concept or technique for computer programming that models Â software architecture around data or objects rather than functions and logic.A data field is referred to as an object if it has distinct characteristics and behaviour. In OOP, everything is categorised as self-sustaining objects.

Among developers, it is the most often used programming paradigm. Large, complicated, and actively updated or maintained programmes work well with it. It provides fundamental ideas like abstraction, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation, which make programme creation and maintenance easier. These fundamental ideas define OOP.
